Named after the architect, the hotel’s elegant restaurant boasts a delightful terrace with views of Čikat bay. At the helm in the kitchen, the young chef (also Austrian) who has plenty of experience at Michelin-starred restaurants uses the best local ingredients to create dishes which are modern and creative without losing sight of flavour and pleasure. The small lunchtime à la carte is supplemented in the evening by two tasting menus – “The Signature” and “Innovation” – with dishes interchangeable between the two menus. On the à la carte, our inspectors recommend the oxtail ravioli with Istrian truffle foam and foie gras, while on the Signature menu they particularly enjoyed the fresh dessert based on a strawberry ragu, basil sorbet, skuta (a type of curd cheese) and ginger.",

Jonnie and Thérèse Boer have built up a kitchen team that loves working with produce from Zwolle, often cooks on the wood fire and manages to create dishes that are original but not overly complex.  Think, for example, a richly buttered brioche that has been toasted crisp, topped with a delicate horseradish cream, slices of warm smoked eel and a delicate Granny Smith brunoise for tangy and sugary nuances. Sensational! Avocado briefly grilled on the barbecue is incorporated into a punchy dish combining madras curry and a vinaigrette based on soya, oil and a mild vinegar. At Brass Boer Thuis, the chefs are not afraid to use bold flavours, but they always manage to strike the right balance. As a result, the extensive menu is full of mouthwatering options.

The expressive smoky flavour of a rich and buttery beurre blanc, for example, is the ideal accompaniment for a perfectly grilled North Sea turbot served with unripe mango for a hint of freshness.Veal sweetbreads are fried until golden brown, unctuous and crispy, and served alongside aromatic black truffle and a particularly creamy Chablis sauce.

This chef does not shy away from surprising contrasts, but doesn't go overboard either. Think different textures of onion – sweet, delicate, intense, zesty – harmoniously combined with the tang of Belper Knolle cheese. The dishes at Codium are often characterised by salty flavours, acidity and spice, but chef Kik's creativity makes for new impressions every time.

Thanks to its location on the first floor of a building on Breskens marina, you have a fabulous view of the boats bobbing about on the Western Scheldt. The lounge atmosphere is nice and relaxed, and perfectly suited to Laurent Smallegange's cooking: original and fun, without pretension.This young chef makes a point of working with local produce such as eel and crab, which he enhances with fresh tangy notes and influences from around the globe. Each ingredient is given its chance to shine. Every dish is well thought out. An inventive Carabinero prawn dish brings out the saltiness of the shellfish, perfectly cooked veal sweetbreads are daringly combined with chives and the subtle oiliness of Eastern Scheldt eel: chef Smallegange's technique is certainly masterful but also playful. No frills, just an abundance of sparkling flavours.If you would prefer to drop by in summer for a slightly simpler, casual lunch, do try Eb & Food just next door.",

        "description": "De Kas has grown steadily since being established in 2001 and has now reached maturity. \"From plant to plate\" has always been the motto here, a vision of sustainability that seemed anything but easy to achieve at the outset. But they persevered and today are a standard-bearer of the MICHELIN Green Star. They grow about 300 varieties of vegetables, herbs and fruit both on site and in their larger field in the Beemster Polder. What is harvested in the morning from the imposing greenhouse will take pride of place a little later, in light, modern creations. Tip: Make a beeline for the great garden terrace. Wim de Beer and Jos Timmer are masters in the art of delicately balancing sweet and sour flavours. Subtle sauces highlight the creative vegetable preparations (sometimes with meat or fish). For instance, they will create a foam out of oyster leaf in order to give a cod fillet some salty pep. Roasted hazelnuts provide texture, rapini a leafy bitterness. If they have any Jerusalem artichoke left over, they will slow-cook it and combine it with yoghurt cream infused with nut oil and parsley. The wealth of natural produce that these chefs have at their disposal is a constant source of inspiration for their creativity. And that is what gourmets really revel in.",

Fermentation and zesty flavours are astutely incorporated. For instance, he elevates sea bass fried on the bone with the intense, full flavour of an anchovy and fermented asparagus sauce. Delicious! A punchy xo sauce made with Dutch shrimps accompanying a succulent skate wing has the same effect.

        "description": "From the moment the exquisite amuse-bouches are served, Cas Pikaar's talent is plain to see. This young chef fuses classic craftsmanship with unbridled creativity. The young chef was previously to be seen in action at the Bib Gourmand-awarded DOYY in Eindhoven, but now he is striking out in Hilvarenbeek. His restaurant is inviting and stylish, his youthful enthusiasm compelling. Chef Pikaar's culinary skill is beyond question; his Anjou pigeon, for instance, is cooked to perfection and sliced. The meat melts in the mouth, the confit legs and the heart are deliciously intense, the creaminess of the liver is full of depth – a true labour of love! He is more playful with the garnishes, using different vinaigrettes or adding a touch of spice. This is a chef who likes to put his own spin on classics such as tournedos Rossini, but might also elevate a scallop dish with a kombu beurre blanc. As he himself says, he enjoys creating contrasts, but within limits. And that is exactly how he demonstrates his talent. The key ingredient is showcased against a backdrop of nuances.",

The large oyster bar, the walls adorned with the menus of legendary French brasseries, the vintage crockery on the tables: this place is a celebration of a bygone era. Traditional fish recipes are given a fresh but down-to-earth twist with a sure hand. Richard van Oostenbrugge and Thomas Groot are once again making their mark here with no-nonsense dishes that you can feast on every day of the week – including at lunchtime! For example, a generous portion of perfectly cooked mussels are served, dotted with vadouvan mayonnaise and calamansi jelly, which add freshness and nuance without spoiling the seafood's distinctive flavour. As a nod to the traditional recipe, a creamy vadouvan soup and green celery provide the finishing touch to this delicious reinterpretation. A beautiful piece of turbot roasted on the bone is topped with morels incorporating a mousse created from the fish's barbel, fine slices of lardo di colonnata and a rich beurre blanc. This is next-level fish cuisine. Old school. Original. And it can all be ordered à la carte!",

First and foremost, the modern cuisine, which is rife with flavour and sophisticated, but at the same time down-to-earth and accessible. The atmosphere is suitably unpretentious, which is in no small part down to the exceptionally congenial hosts. Despite the high quality of the produce they use – a very serious matter here, the prices are really reasonable! The same goes for the wine list, especially those by the bottle.

He has also built great relationships with the local producers and suppliers, and their seasonal ingredients form the backbone of his menus. Don’t be fooled by the simple descriptions as these belie the complexity of the techniques used in his creative modern dishes, where flavours, textures and temperatures come together in perfect harmony.

Menus evolve throughout the year and the produce used is at its peak: this in turn allows the kitchen to keep things simple and allow the main ingredient to shine. Well-balanced dishes burst with flavour and often feature retro or playful elements.

For example, he may mix fish with a tartare steak conjuring up subtle, savoury nuances or perfectly crisp calf sweetbread might be flanked with morel mushrooms and home-made sausage stuffed with truffle. One thing is certain – choosing between the house signature dishes and the more inventive creations is something of a conundrum. Even though red meat is at the core of Michielsen’s reputation, his fish dishes are equally worthy of mention. The flavoursome palette of appetising side dishes confirms the chef’s high-flying culinary talent.",

The chef intelligently adds a zest of modernity to produce whose quality is beyond compare. For example, noble ingredients like scallops or cod are served with the simplest of side dishes in a bid to keep the flavours strong and authentic. Examples include a juicy breast of guinea fowl with a crisp golden skin and a punchy white wine sauce. The main ingredient, generally meat, is underscored by side dishes such as morels, salsify, mash with lashings of butter and fermented red cabbage. This is wholesome Belgian fare at its best - oozing in authenticity, flavour and generosity. The final flourish is supplied by the sommelier, who can be relied upon to find just the right wine to pair with your meal from a cellar of predominantly French vintages.

Subtle elegance also depicts the couple’s culinary ethos and their food demonstrates an equal attention to detail and to artistic plating. Familiar flavours are highlighted in suave creations that mingle intensity with fresh acidity, illustrated by confit of kumquats and sweet and sour pearl onions which perfectly set off a semi-cooked foie gras with duck jus, while bergamot adds interesting nuances to a confit of lobster tail in beurre blanc.

        "description": "In this trendy part of Antwerp, Le Pristine is synonymous with Sergio Herman’s stylish hallmark. The laid-back cocktail bar is open all day (with or without a booking) for casual snacks and nibbles. Do you fancy mussels from Zeeland flavoured with fresh, gutsy lovage and savoury pecorino? Or a Mediterranean mini pizza on an aspic theme? The restaurant is reminiscent of an upmarket brasserie with a high ceiling, polished table service and a hip interior that mingles designer and vintage features. In the ubiquitous open-plan kitchen, Chris Blom, a disciple of Herman, quietly gets down to business, blending Italian romanticism and seafood delights with great sensitivity. Balanced, fresh and acidic, even surprising at times. We highly recommend the cannelloni stuffed with Eastern Scheldt lobster and served with a delicate white wine sauce. It’s nice to know that all the dishes on the carte can be shared. World class cuisine and a vibrant hotspot.",

Chef Bruno pays homage to authentic recipes, transforming them with modern techniques, yet always in a bid to allow the ingredient to shout its name. Italian generosity meets subtle craftsmanship as the Italian chef adds his own hallmark to familiar flavours. His signature dish: a velvety compact mousse of stracciatella with a tomato sorbet and basil-perfumed oil features three ingredients that are blended together in a knockout harmony of taste and aroma. We also recommend the braised seabass overflowing in savoury, sweet and spicy notes and liberally sprinkled in sultana raisins marinated in vinegar.

A glazed ageing cabinet takes pride of place in the centre, while runners on the ceiling bear witness to a bygone era when the carcasses were shunted overhead. A long communal table is designed to encourage diners to share this experience. The exceptional cuts of meat of this renowned butcher are consummately and creatively prepared, perfectly seasoned and cooked in a Josper charcoal oven by chef Timon Michiels. The perfect place to find out more about how meat is aged and about different cattle breeds. Rather than fries or over-powering sauces, you can expect delicate side dishes rich in flavour: thyme-flavoured vinaigrette, subtly spicy horseradish cream and marinated cauliflower are served with a full-bodied carpaccio of beef tongue.

Charles Bernabé (who for a long time worked alongside Christophe Hay) carefully selects exceptional quality ingredients, from the best vegetables from local market gardeners or the finest fish from the nearby fish markets – and that is the key to the success of a starter like his mackerel, tomato and pepper. He is certainly no rookie, masterfully juggling numerous balls: his classical foundations, the zeitgeist, his grandmother's Breton culture and even his father's pied-noir origins. All this without ever compromising on the clarity of his dishes and the flavour of his sauces. Contemporary setting inspired by 1950s design, charming and precise service.",

Born in Kyoto, he belongs to the large family of Japanese chefs who have fallen for France's culinary heritage. He elevates exceptionally fresh ingredients (Miéral poultry, Wagyu beef) by playing on textures, bitterness and acidity: peas, broad beans and snow peas with tamarind, crab and caviar; beetroot tarte tatin with strawberries and foie gras; squab cooked over a cherry wood fire… At every meal, he enchants his clientele with his seasonal symphony. On top of that, the service is extremely obliging.",

His squid-ink cuttlefish cannelloni with a shellfish jus made with fresh basil leaves and his saddle of lamb cooked in Vallauris clay have become real signature dishes.",

Chef Arnaud Philippon's cuisine flirts with the zeitgeist: toasted white asparagus, nasturtiums and egg yolk sauce; pan-roasted blue lobster, chickpeas from the Loches area, buckwheat and blackcurrant shoots; hot soufflé with Touraine blackcurrants and fresh blackcurrant sorbet. Delicate execution, balanced flavours, ingredients sourced from local producers: this is château life at its best.",

Using regional produce (spider crab, monkfish, carp), he comes up with bold and original combinations, and chooses just the right emulsions, jus and condiments to boost his dishes (e.g. wild garlic on carp, kumquat on monkfish). For dessert, his carrot confit, white chocolate mousse, coriander, carrot cake and herb sorbet is exemplary.",

There is also a grocery store-cum-delicatessen to take goodies home and the lunchtime menu is a steal. We warrant that this is only the beginning of the story.",

To celebrate his tenth anniversary, chef Jan opened a cheese bar opposite his restaurant serving twenty different cheeses, a range of beverages, preserves and dried fruit.

His food is thus rich in emotion and establishes a natural complicity with the region, particularly through the use of first-rate local fruit and vegetables and other top-quality ingredients, whilst compromising nothing in terms of high-precision cooking. His weekday lunchtime Market menu is a bargain!",

Meals typically begin with Chef Hiroyuki Naruke, who gracefully prepares every item and thoughtfully serves each diner. Edomae sushi arrives as an omakase of sublime fish, while other courses may commence with downright flawless sashimi and nigiri. Case in point—amberjack sashimi with onions and soy, where each morsel is sliced, seasoned and set before your eye. This may be tailed by such delicious nigiri as Hokkaido scallops, kohada and fatty tuna.The pleasure of dining here extends right to the simple, spongy and fluffy block of tamago.",

Diners may then look forward to the likes of a coconut broth replete with bluefin tuna, Thai curry aromatics, and charred avocado; or tortellini in brodo with a burst of savory broth.Dessert arrives as both a modern expression (herbed granita with lemon curd) and ode to nostalgia (chocolate cake with a caramelized white chocolate- and popcorn-pudding).",

On it, he unveils his full culinary mastery – the finishing touches to many of his visually inspired dishes are added in front of guests to enable them to fully appreciate the innumerable (and often magical) techniques that he employs. He always works with the very best seasonal ingredients and organises the culinary experience around 4 different options: Tasting, 7 Wine Regions, Mature Wines, and 7 Million Bubbles. Make sure you book well ahead.",

Here, the extensive à la carte of traditional Mediterranean cooking is heavily focused towards the open grill, along with savoury rice dishes and top-quality, fresh seasonal ingredients.

His à la carte features seasonal dishes, including game, and his famous Pularda poultry dish. Els Casals is a fine example of sustainability, with a philosophy centred on zero-miles ingredients.

The dishes on the à la carte and the two tasting menus (Lúa and Lúa Chea) are focused around a fully contemporary culinary approach with a strong Celtic influence, and one which maximises the use of seasonal ingredients that bring out the best of each other. We particularly enjoyed the signature “Pulpo a feira” octopus dish and the “Tarta líquida de Santiago”, a new take on the classic dessert but one which pays homage to the chef’s roots.

Here, chef Francesc Rovira, a disciple of the late great Santi Santamaria, oversees creative-cum-contemporary cuisine that clearly identifies with the region and which is tremendously tasty, aromatic and enticing despite the use of modest culinary techniques. It also features an array of delicate details and a philosophy that involves working with the best locally sourced seasonal ingredients (meat, potatoes, wild mushrooms, sausages etc).

The brother is the chef, the sister (who has a remarkable knowledge of wines) and her friendly husband work front of house and the new generation is also at hand, ready and willing to learn all about the profession. Local produce – both meat and fish – takes pride of place on the menu here, served in dishes with an occasionally creative twist.

Secluded and surrounded by greenery (it’s best to ask for directions before you set out!), the setting is yet another reason for choosing this restaurant. It was a love of cooking and of this region that persuaded Signora Anna many years ago to convert an old tobacco shop into a trattoria. From its early beginnings, the restaurant has grown from strength to strength, supported by hard work and research that has led it to becoming one of the Abruzzo’s leading restaurants, in which aromatic herbs grown in the kitchen garden add extra flavour to the house specialities. Alessio and Mattia Spadone are the third generation of the family that has run the restaurant ever since their grandmother founded it in the late 1970s, followed by their parents, Bruna and Marcello, who transformed it into the elegant, famous restaurant we see today.",

His menus showcase local ingredients, which he prepares with technical expertise, occasionally combining them with produce from other parts of Italy. Although the adjacent Bistrot is designed to be more informal in character, it offers the attraction of reliable Italian cuisine and the option of dining alfresco.",

Guests flock here because of the restaurant’s reputation and leave delighted by new discoveries.

In addition to the Dorona di Venezia vineyard, the restaurant also has a kitchen garden which provides most of its vegetables, including unusual varieties such as “castraure”, a type of local artichoke. Once out of the garden, you come to a small wooden bridge which links Mazzorbo to neighbouring Burano, where you can complete your visit to the lagoon by exploring the lacemakers’ shops and admiring the colourful local houses. The main focus here, however, is the cuisine – and excellent cuisine it is too! Chefs Chiara Pavan and Francesco Brutto describe their dishes as “ambientale” (environmental) because of the close connection between the lagoon and the Upper Adriatic: the menu features plenty of fish and vegetables and almost no meat. Guests choose their number of courses and the dishes come as a surprise, accompanied by organic wine pairings. At the Osteria Contemporanea next door the dishes are simpler but still full of flavour.",

Then there is Arno Sgier's technically ambitious cuisine. His dishes give a modern twist to classic fare – he enjoys putting his own spin on traditional recipes. Those who like a glass of good wine or two to go with a first-class meal are in for a treat, because the wine list really does have many treasures in store, especially in the bottles section. In the evening, you can choose between the \"Traube\" set menu and a set menu of appetisers. At midday there is the three-course lunch menu.",

Now, it enters an exciting new chapter in its long history. A single tasting menu yields a breadth of dishes that never masquerade as meat. Beet carpaccio with horseradish and pecorino is a superb effort, while carrot marinara pizza with carrot pepperoni is spellbinding.Dessert, too, follows in the same imaginative vein. An espresso cookie capped with Brussels sprout-caramel and white chocolate is a testament to the team's ingenuity. A meal of this caliber is a true experience and guests are sure to leave feeling nourished.",

Dishes turned out of this kitchen usually vary according to the seasons, but could include the likes of wonderfully tender squid, succulent Hokkaido scallop, plump matsutake, as well as subtly sweet onion.

The sweet/salty flavour of exceptionally delicious crab, for instance, is subtly emphasised by the addition of mayonnaise and an iceberg lettuce granita for a sharper finish.

Modern urban surroundings make for a pleasantly laid-back atmosphere. Bag a table near the open kitchen and you can chat to the chefs, who also deliver the food themselves.

The wine list will have oenophiles in raptures and contemporary bedrooms complete the package.",

Times have changed and chef David Martin has swapped the traditional brasserie score for a brand-new menu that is as impressive as the décor. La Paix now blends Brussels’ heritage with Japanese minimalism, depicted by a shimmering flock of origami birds hanging from the ceiling and soft lighting, setting an almost reverential vibe, while Martin and his team add the final touch to their creations on the “altar”. You can choose between two formulas, named after the respective fathers of the chef and the lady of the house, which pair polished pedigree Gallicism with Japanese purity, creating a distinctive gastronomic signature. Chef Martin is on a permanent quest for perfection and the flavours are often bold, sometimes even disruptive. He enjoys surprising diners right from the appetisers, with, for example, pig’s ears cooked in a hint of soy sauce with moist steamed mussels in a vinaigrette based on mussel stock. He masterfully works with dashi, miso and koji, adding a surprising new kick to noble ingredients such as monkfish or turbot.

Even before the first bite, you are engulfed by the feeling of luxury as a birthright… Ralf, a true perfectionist, now makes his entrance. He spices up familiar flavours with delicate nuances and subtle international produce. Fabulous, rare ingredients such as hamachi and Polder’s hare are flawlessly prepared, but the chef also enjoys surprising us with bold associations. For example, his melt-in-the-mouth fillet of venison is set off by a concoction of taggiasca olives and the tangy sweetness of pineapple. The fascinating balance of these powerful flavours demonstrates the full gamut of this high-flying chef’s talent, particularly visible in his sauces. Discerning foodies will be further delighted to learn that Ralf was a baker-pastry chef in a former life, hence the irresistible bread and biscuit trolley.",

It all comes together to enhance that French art de vivre – the opulent and refined decor and ultra competent service, the celebration of the finest ingredients from the abundant Bordeaux and Aquitaine region (foie gras, truffles, caviar, fish), the superb cheese trolley… and the solid silver Christofle lobster press that is moved from table to table. The competence of the three sommeliers is remarkable, as they advise you on the 1 000-bottle selection, two thirds of which are from Bordeaux, naturally!",

Under the impetus of Olivier Bellin, who returned in 1998, the transformation of this family-run Auberge was complete: inventive and versatile, the chef came into his own, brandishing an increasingly strong culinary personality. He works with an extraordinary network of carefully selected small-scale producers in Finistère, and there is a card on each table listing where each ingredient is from and who produced it. His dishes marry sea and land as if they were the most natural of partners: potato soufflé stuffed with oyster jus; langoustine and pig's trotter; cheese tortellini and trout eggs.",

A certain kind of confidence, boldness and measured risk-taking. For example, when it comes to local ingredients and spices from afar, it's not either/or, it's both! A scorpion fish from Nice comes up against a fish broth enhanced with vadouvan, a heavily aromatic blend of Indian spices... They often go out on a limb, but the risk always pays off.

We very much enjoyed the Omaggio a Milano – tortelli pasta stuffed with Fassona beef ossobuco and marrow in a Sardinian saffron and parmesan reduction.

Though it's now under the stewardship of Chef Esther Ha, some things remain unchanged, like the upbeat soundtrack, sleek counter staged around a kitchen with nowhere to hide and a vibe so relaxed that diners might even sing along.Chef Ha brings new ideas to the fore. A sweet potato, slow-roasted until it achieves an almost custardy texture, is served with dashi broth and crispy fried yuba, while a perfectly crisp \"cutlet\" of panko-breaded mushroom, is paired with an ultra-rich sauce of foie gras and caramelized doenjang. Desserts display irreverent creativity, as in a Bakewell tart made with a sweet tomato jam and served with a juniper-scented whipped cream.",

In tune with this seasonal ethos, the chef works with meat, but very sparingly, (for example, during the coarse fish close season), depicted by a game jus drizzled over cardoons (heirloom vegetable). Similarly, the wines all come from local wineries. The duo of chefs is committed to exploring new culinary universes, for example, they offer a “food and jus” pairing of vegetable stocks, broths and herbal teas with the different courses, in addition to wine-food pairings.

Memories shine bright of both the mackerel cooked over hot embers and accompanied by confit beetroot or an incredible lettuce grilled over a flame, blueberries in elderflower vinegar and the dessert of buckwheat, caramel mousse, confit citrus fruits and sea lettuce (seaweed) sorbet. The interior has been revamped in natural materials and soft colours, while the grocery shop, Le Petit Couillon, sells produce from the artisans and farmer partners.",

Hailing from Normandy, chef Dimitri Droisneau has a CV to be reckoned with (La Tour d'Argent, Lucas Carton, Ambroisie); he fell in love with Provence, which for him is a constant source of inspiration. From one dish to another, it makes its presence felt – light, subtle, tasty, fresh and aromatic, punchy when necessary, and always surprising and original. All the magic of the South of France – produce from land and sea, its fish and herbs, wild and otherwise – is channelled to great effect in this cuisine. A case in point: the Carabineros prawn, red berry tartlet, in which the marriage of the iodine and saline of the shellfish with the fruit is in the realm of the celestial. Meanwhile, the charismatic sommelier has no shortage of savvy wine proposals and the chef's wife deftly illustrates the art of carving at table.",

After working alongside many of the greats, he struck out on his own… and found what he was looking for in Menton. Mirazur is the \"last house before Italy\" and looks the sky and the open sea straight in the eye: many a visitor has been hypnotised by the exceptional view of the Mediterranean. Supported by a talented team and a firm believer in the benefits of ultra-short food supply chains (his permaculture vegetable garden is proof of this), Mauro Colagreco is at the top of his game. In tune with lunar cycles, transcending the seasons and the region, his cuisine is a daily ode to aromatic plants, flowers, vegetables and citrus fruits. An unforgettable experience.",

In this striking setting, decorated with flying pigs and huge chrome ants, the single tasting menu invites his guests on a spectacular journey across the world’s different cuisines that features recognisable flavours and gives greater visibility to Spanish ingredients but without any specific leitmotif. As only Muñoz is able, he adds exotic embellishments to his intense gastronomic “canvases” that are always teeming with contrasts and combine flavours to absolute perfection.",

It’s worth coming here simply to experience the service, an impeccable waltz directed by Alessandro Tomberli, one of the best maître-d’s in Italy. Annie Féolde, one of the restaurant’s icons, left the reins to the highly talented chef Riccardo Monco, who continues to nurture and satisfy the Italian appetite for fine cuisine. Credit must also go to Giorgio Pinchiorri, who has developed a wine list that is renowned across the globe.",

Today, careful renovation of the elegant dining rooms and veranda overlooking the garden adds to the charm. However, it was talented chef Antonino Cannavacciuolo who made this villa famous throughout Italy and further afield. This chef from Vico Equense has poured heart and soul into this restaurant (he has even named one of his menus “Anima”, the Italian for “soul”), using all his technical skill and precision to create dishes full of clean and distinct flavours. Two further tasting menus are available: the classic Itinerario dal sud al nord Italia (A Journey from southern to northern Italy) and Traccia which explores flavours from Campania up to Piedmont with all the confidence that only truly great chefs can muster. Highly attentive service, plus a wine selection that includes labels from around the world.",
