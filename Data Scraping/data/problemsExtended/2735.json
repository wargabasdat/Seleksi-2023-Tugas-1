We will buy the 1<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;type of chocolate at a cost of 1.\nNow, we will perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the types of chocolates will become [1,2,0]. We will buy the 2<sup>nd</sup><sup> </sup>type of chocolate at a cost of 1.\nNow, we will again perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the chocolate types will become [2,0,1]. We will buy the 0<sup>th </sup>type of chocolate at a cost of 1. \nThus, the total cost will become (1 + 5 + 1 + 5 + 1) = 13.
