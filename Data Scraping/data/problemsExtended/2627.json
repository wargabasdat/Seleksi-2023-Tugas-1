The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.</p>\n\n<p>For example, let's say&nbsp;<code>t = 50ms</code>, and the function was called at&nbsp;<code>30ms</code>,&nbsp;<code>60ms</code>, and <code>100ms</code>. The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at&nbsp;<code>150ms</code>. If instead&nbsp;<code>t = 35ms</code>, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at&nbsp;<code>95ms</code>, and the 3rd would be executed at&nbsp;<code>135ms</code>.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"Debounce Schematic\" src=\"https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2023/04/08/screen-shot-2023-04-08-at-11048-pm.png\" style=\"width: 800px; height: 242px;\"></p>\n\n<p>The above diagram&nbsp;shows how debounce will transform&nbsp;events.
